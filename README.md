## Installation

**Step 1.** [Download Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) and follow
the instructions to install Ollama for your operating system. Then, pull
and run [llama3.1](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1) (parameters: 8B,
quantization: Q4_0, size: 4.7 GB) according to the ollama documentation.

**Step 2.** Setup a new virtual environment, such as with Conda. Quick
command line instructions on how to install Miniconda, a free minimal
installer for Conda, can be found
[here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install).

``` sh
$ conda create -n scholaris-env python=3.12
```

**Step 3.** Activate the virtual environment:

``` sh
$ conda activate scholaris-env
```

**Step 4.** Install latest scholaris Python package from the GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/nicomarr/scholaris):

``` sh
$ pip install git+https://github.com/nicomarr/scholaris.git
```

or from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/scholaris/):

``` sh
$ pip install scholaris
```

**Step 5.** Install the following dependencies:

``` sh
$ pip install ollama
$ pip install PyPDF2
$ pip install requests
$ pip install tqdm
```

## Getting started

Import the scholaris core module. If you work from a Jupyter notebook
environment within a different directory, you may need to add the parent
directory of the current working directory to the Python system path as
shown below.

``` python
import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.getcwd())) # To add the parent directory to the path
from scholaris.core import *
```

Make sure the Ollama app is installed on your local computer and Llama
3.1 8B has been downloaded and is running. Then, initialize the
`Assistant` class with Llama 3.1 8B, the core functions and default
system message. During initialization, messages are printed to indicate
whether credentials such as API keys and email are loaded from the
environment variables (more on that below), and whether a local data
directory already exists or has been created, like so:

``` python
assistant = Assistant()
```

    Loaded Semantic Scholar API key from the environment variables.
    Loaded email address from the environment variables.
    A local directory ../data already exists for storing data files. No of files: 1

> [!NOTE]
>
> For the examples shown below, a local data directory had already been
> created in the parent directory prior to initialization, and a PDF
> file was downloaded and saved to the local data directory for
> demonstration purposes. You can download the same PDF file, or
> additional/other files by running the following commands in a Jupyter
> notebook cell. Alternatively, you can download and add the files
> manually to the local data directory if the assistant has already been
> initialized.
>
> ``` python
> !mkdir -p ../data
> pdf_urls = [
>     "https://df6sxcketz7bb.cloudfront.net/manuscripts/144000/144499/jci.insight.144499.v2.pdf",
>     # Add more URLs here as needed
> ]
> for url in pdf_urls:
>     !curl -o ../data/$(basename {url}) {url}
> ```

You can also explicitly set the model by passing the model name as an
argument to the `Assistant` class. If you do not pass a model name, the
default model is ***Llama 3.1*** 8B. An alternative model that supports
tool calling and can be run on a standard laptop is Mistral’s ***NeMo***
12 B model. To use the latter model, change the attribute in the
`Assistant` class to “mistral-nemo”. For more information, read the
following [blog post](https://ollama.com/blog/tool-support).

``` python
assistant = Assistant(model="llama3.1:latest")
```

    Loaded Semantic Scholar API key from the environment variables.
    Loaded email address from the environment variables.
    A local directory ../data already exists for storing data files. No of files: 1

## How to use

To chat with the assistant, simply call the `chat()` method with your
prompt as input:

``` python
assistant.chat("Which pdf files do you have access to on the local computer?")
```



    I have access to 1 PDF file on the local computer:

    * jci.insight.144499.v2.pdf

By setting `show_progress=True`, you can see the step-by-step progress
of the fuction calling. This includes the tool choice, selected
arguments, if applicable, and the output of the called function that is
being passed back to the LLM to generate the final response.

``` python
assistant.chat("Get the title of this PDF file.", show_progress=True)
```

    Selecting tools...

    [{'function': {'name': 'get_titles_and_first_authors', 'arguments': {}}}]
    Calling get_titles_and_first_authors() with arguments {}...



    Function response:
    [
      {
        "title": "Distinct antibody repertoires against endemic human coronaviruses in children and adults",
        "first_author": "Taushif Khan",
        "file_name": "jci.insight.144499.v2.pdf"
      }
    ]

    Generating final response...


    The title of the PDF file is:

    "Distinct antibody repertoires against endemic human coronaviruses in children and adults"

    Extracting titles and first authors: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:07<00:00,  7.69s/it]

To get information about a research article from external sources,
simply ask the assistant:

``` python
assistant.chat("Get the number of citations for the study entitled 'Tuberculosis and impaired IL-23–dependent IFN-γ immunity in humans homozygous for a common TYK2 missense variant.'")
```



    The study entitled 'Tuberculosis and impaired IL-23–dependent IFN-γ immunity in humans homozygous for a common TYK2 missense variant' has been cited 161 times.

    You are an AI assistant specialized in analyzing research articles.
            Your role is to provide concise, human-readable responses based on information from tools and conversation history.

            Key instructions:
            1. Use provided tools to gather information before answering.
            2. Interpret tool results and provide clear, concise answers in natural language.
            3. If you can't answer with available tools, state this clearly.
            4. Don't provide information if tool content is empty.
            5. Never include raw JSON, tool outputs, or formatting tags in responses.
            6. Format responses as plain text for direct human communication.
            7. Use clear formatting (e.g., numbered or bulleted lists) when appropriate.
            8. Provide article details (e.g., DOI, citation count) in a conversational manner.

            Act as a knowledgeable research assistant, offering clear and helpful information based on available tools and data.
            

## Local data access

By default, the assistant has access to a single directory, called
`data`. Within this directory, the assistant can list and read the
following file formats and extensions: pdf, txt, md, markdown, csv, and
py. If not already present, the directory is created when the assistant
is initialized. If you want to change the directory name, you can do so
by passing the desired directory name as an argument to the `Assistant`
class when it is initialized. For example, to create a directory called
`proprietary_data`, you would initialize the assistant as follows:

``` python
assistant = Assistant(dir_path="../proprietary_data")
```

    Loaded Semantic Scholar API key from the environment variables.
    Loaded email address from the environment variables.
    Created directory ../proprietary_data for storing data files.

## Tools

By default, the assistant can call a set of core tools or functions
which are passed to the `Assistant` as a dictionary when it is
initialized. With these tools or functions, the assistant will be able
to get a list of file names in a specific data directory, can extract
content from these files, and summarize them. In addition, the assistant
can make API calls to external data sources, such as
[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org) or [Semantic
Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org), to retrieve information about
a large number of scholarly articles. The tools available to the
assistant can be viewed by accessing the assistant’s `list_tools()`
method as follows:

``` python
assistant.list_tools()
```

    get_file_names
    extract_text_from_pdf
    get_titles_and_first_authors
    summarize_local_document
    describe_python_code
    query_openalex_api
    query_semantic_scholar_api
    respond_to_generic_queries

> [!TIP]
>
> You can learn more details about the core tools by visiting the Source
> Code page, which lists each function and provides a brief description
> of its purpose, functionality, required arguments, and usage (the
> docstring). This information helps you understand the available tools
> and how the LLM uses them. Alternatively, if you prefer to see the
> schema for all tools the assistant can call, you can execute the
> `assistant.get_tools_schema()` method.

## Authentication for tool calling and API access (optional)

Some tools take optional authentication parameters, such as an API key
or email. For example, the `query_semantic_scholar` tool takes an
optional API key to access the Semantic Scholar API, which will increase
the API rate limit. Request a Semantic Scholar API Key
[here](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api/tutorial). Similarly,
the `query_openaplex_api` tool takes an optional email parameter to
access the OpenAlex API, which is recommended as a best practice and
kindly requested by the [API
provider](https://docs.openalex.org/how-to-use-the-api/rate-limits-and-authentication#the-polite-pool).

The best way to pass these parameters is to set them as environment
variables, with the following key names: `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` and
`EMAIL`. The Assistant class will automatically read these environment
variables when initialized and pass them to the tools that require them.
Alternatively, you can pass the Semantic Scholar API key and your email
by simply adding the authentication argument when initializing the
Assistant class, as shown below:

``` python
authentication = {
    "SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
    "EMAIL": "your_email@example.com"
}
assistant = Assistant(authentication=authentication)
```

    A local directory ../data already exists for storing data files. No of files: 1

If you want to change the core functions, you can do so by passing the
desired core functions as an argument to the Assistant class when it is
initialized. For example, to limit the assitant’s ability to respond to
generic questions and to access external data by making requests to the
OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar API’s, you would initialize the assistant
as follows:

``` python
assistant = Assistant(tools = {
    "query_openalex_api": query_openalex_api,
    "query_semantic_scholar_api": query_semantic_scholar_api,
    "respond_to_generic_queries": respond_to_generic_queries,
    })
```

    Loaded Semantic Scholar API key from the environment variables.
    Loaded email address from the environment variables.
    A local directory ../data already exists for storing data files. No of files: 1

> [!NOTE]
>
> The research assistent is set up so that it has to use a tool to
> generate a final response to a user’s prompt. This is to ensure that
> the assistant is primarily providing information which is relevant for
> health and life sciences. Otherwise it will abort the conversation,
> like so:

``` python
assistant = Assistant(tools = {})
assistant.chat("What is the capital of France?")
```

    Loaded Semantic Scholar API key from the environment variables.
    Loaded email address from the environment variables.
    A local directory ../data already exists for storing data files. No of files: 1

    No tools provided! Please add tools to the assistant.
    No tool calls found in the response. Adding an empty tool_calls list to the conversation history. Aborting...

## Developer Guide

### Defining new tools

You can define new functions to be used by the assistant as tools. To
simplify this process, a decorator called `@json_schema_decorator` is
provided so it is not necessary to define the schema for the function.
The schema is automatically generated based on the function’s annotation
and docstring.

> [!TIP]
>
> Here are key points to consider when defining a new tool:
>
> - Use type hints in the function signature to define the input and
>   output types.
> - Use docstrings, as shown below, to describe the function’s purpose
>   and the expected input and output.
> - Use the `@json_schema_decorator` decorator to automatically generate
>   the schema for the function.
> - Ensure the output is a string (such as a JSON-formatted string) that
>   can be passed back to the LLM to generate the final response.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> It’s crucial to understand that this metadata (function name, type
> hints, and docstring) is all the information the LLM has access to
> when deciding which function to call and how to use it. The LLM does
> not have access to or information about the actual source code or
> implementation of the functions (unless explicitly provided).
> Therefore, the metadata must be comprehensive and accurate to ensure
> proper function selection and usage by the LLM.

The following example shows how to define a new tool called
`multiply_two_integers` that takes two integers as input and returns a
string as output:

``` python
@json_schema_decorator
def multiply_two_integers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    A function to multiply two numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): First integer.
        b (int): Second integer.

    Returns:
        str: The product of the two numbers, as a string.
    """

    if not isinstance(a, int) or not isinstance(b, int):
        return "Error: Inputs must be integers."
    
    return str(a * b)
```

To ensure the JSON schema is generated correctly, you can call the
`json_schema` attribute of the function:

``` python
multiply_two_integers.json_schema
```

    {'type': 'function',
     'function': {'name': 'multiply_two_integers',
      'description': 'A function to multiply two numbers.',
      'parameters': {'type': 'object',
       'properties': {'a': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'First integer.'},
        'b': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Second integer.'}},
       'required': ['a', 'b']}}}

Alternatively, you can use the `generate_json_schema` function:

``` python
generate_json_schema(multiply_two_integers)
```

    {'type': 'function',
     'function': {'name': 'multiply_two_integers',
      'description': 'A function to multiply two numbers.',
      'parameters': {'type': 'object',
       'properties': {'a': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'First integer.'},
        'b': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Second integer.'}},
       'required': ['a', 'b']}}}

### Adding tools

You can add new tools by passing a dictionary of new tools to the
`Assistant` class when it is initialized. Use the `add_tools` argument
to add new tools to the assistant. This will merge the new tools with
the existing tools. For example, to add the new tool called
`multiply_two_integers` to the assistant, you would initialize the
assistant as follows:

``` python
assistant = Assistant(add_tools = {"multiply_two_integers": multiply_two_integers})
```

    Loaded Semantic Scholar API key from the environment variables.
    Loaded email address from the environment variables.
    A local directory ../data already exists for storing data files. No of files: 1

You can confirm that the new tool has been added to the list of existing
tools by using the `list_tools()` method:

``` python
assistant.list_tools()
```

    get_file_names
    extract_text_from_pdf
    get_titles_and_first_authors
    summarize_local_document
    describe_python_code
    query_openalex_api
    query_semantic_scholar_api
    respond_to_generic_queries
    multiply_two_integers

``` python
assistant.chat("What is the product of 4173 and 351?", show_progress=True)
```

    Selecting tools...

    [{'function': {'name': 'multiply_two_integers', 'arguments': {'a': 4173, 'b': 351}}}]
    Calling multiply_two_integers() with arguments {'a': 4173, 'b': 351}...

    Function response:
    1464723

    Generating final response...


    The product of 4173 and 351 is 1,464,723.

### Adding methods

You can add new methods to the `Assistant` class by using the
`add_to_class()` decorator function. For example, the
`clear_conversion_history` method was added to the `Assistant` class as
follows:

``` python
@add_to_class(Assistant)
def clear_conversion_history(self):
    """Clear the conversation history."""
    self.messages = [{'role': "system", 'content': self.sys_message},]
```
