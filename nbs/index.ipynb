    "## About Scholaris\n",
    "Scholaris is a Python package that sets up a research assistant on your local computer, leveraging function calling capabilities. Designed specifically for health and life sciences, it helps researchers gain insights from scholarly articles by integrating with the [Ollama Python library](https://pypi.org/project/ollama/)."

    "- **Local setup:** No dependency on cloud-hosted LLMs for inference.\n",
    "- **Extract data from local files:** Built-in tools to extract data from PDFs, py files, and plain text or markdown files.\n",
    "- **External data retrieval:** Built-in tools to make API calls to external data sources, such as [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/), [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/), or NCBI's [Any ID converter](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/utils/idconv/v1.0/).\n",
    "- **Customizable and extensible architecture:** Easily extend the functionality of the assistant by adding new tools with only a few lines of code.\n"
